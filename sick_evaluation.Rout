> ## Use this R script as follows:
> 
> ## R --no-save --slave --vanilla --args your-scores gold < sick_evaluation.R 
> 
> ## where your-scores is the file with your system output and gold is
> ## the gold standard file (for example, the SICK_trial.txt and
> ## SICK_train.txt files we already released).
> 
> ## Your file must contain the following 3 tab-delimited columns:
> 
> ## -pair_ID (the ids, that should match those in the relevant set
> ## -trial, train or test data set),
> 
> ## - entailment_judgment (predictions of your system for the
> ## entailment sub-task; possible values: ENTAILMENT, CONTRADICTION,
> ## NEUTRAL) and
> 
> ## - relatedness_score (numerical predictions of your system for the
> ## sentence relatedness sub-task).
> 
> ## Note that the first line of the file must be a "header" naming the
> ## 3 columns exactly with the 3 strings above (pair_ID,
> ## entailment_judgment and relatedness_score).
> 
> ## The order of the columns and rows does not matter: of course, the
> ## ids must match those in the relevant data sets.
> 
> ## If you do not participate in the entailment or relatedness task,
> ## please provide a column of NA (by that, we mean that you should
> ## literally enter the string NA in each row).
> ## Note that, for either subtask you want to evaluate, you must 
> ## provide a value for each test pair: if your scores contain 1) NAs 
> ## or 2) missing values, the script will 1) ignore the subtask 
> ## or 2) return an error, respectively. 
> 
> ## The script returns system (percentage) accuracy for the entailment
> ## task and Pearson and Spearman correlation scores and mean squared
> ## error for the relatedness task.

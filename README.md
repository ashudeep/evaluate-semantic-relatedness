# evaluate-semantic-relatedness
A system for the task #1 at Semeval 2014

Run script.sh which trains and then tests and diplays the results.

The file feature\_extractor\_5.py extracts features to be used by train.py and test.py

The feature files (too big for github) can be obtained from: http://takelab.fer.hr/sts
